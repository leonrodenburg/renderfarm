Renderfarm
==========

A C++ library for rendering 3D scenes WITHOUT using OpenGL or DirectX.

I came up with this project for a minor course in 3D software engineering. The main goal of the project is to deepen my knowledge about 3D applications and rendering pipelines. As such, it is perfectly possible that this project will never reach a stable version. You are however encouraged to use the code for your own adventures in the world of 3D programming. Please let me know if you build anything cool with it.

For more information on the project and the rendering pipeline, see these documents (both in Dutch):

A lot of the images in these documents come from the excellent book Real-Time Rendering (3rd Edition) by Tomas Akenine-MÃ¶ller, Eric Haines and Naty Hoffman.
