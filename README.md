Renderfarm
==========

A C++ library for rendering 3D scenes WITHOUT using OpenGL or DirectX.

I came up with this project for a minor course in 3D software engineering. The main goal of the project is to deepen my knowledge on 3D applications and rendering pipelines. As such, it is perfectly possible that this project will never reach a stable version. You are however encouraged to use the code for your own adventures in the world of 3D programming. Please let me know if you build anything cool with it.

Prerequisites
==========

If you want to run the Win32 binary of Renderfarm, make sure you have the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555) installed.
